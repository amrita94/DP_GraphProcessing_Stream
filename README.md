# DP_GraphProcessing_Stream
How to achieve DP for graph processing in the streaming setting

Massive graphs arise in any application which has data about both basic entities and the relationships between these entities, e.g., web-pages and hyperlinks, IP addresses and network flows, people and their friendships et al.  However, analyzing these graphs via classical algorithms can be challenging given the sheer size of the graphs. 
One approach of handling such graphs is to process them in the data stream model where the input is defined by a stream of data. For example, the stream could consist of the edges of the graph. Algorithms in this model must process the input stream in the order it arrives while using only a limited amount memory. However more often than not, these datasets containing sensitive information about relationships among a collection of individuals. This gives rise to a privacy challenge - how to release aggregate information about the data without leaking individual information? 
Although there has been separate works in differentially private streaming model  and differentially private graph algorithms in the classical setting there is a dearth of work addressing the privacy concerns of large-scale graph processing in the streaming model. In this project, we will attempt to marry these two settings and propose differentially private graph algorithms in the streaming data model.
